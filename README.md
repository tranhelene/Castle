## Inspiration
It is often hard to find the motivation to study and complete assignments as busy university students.

## What it does
“Castle” is task management app that turns task completion into a fun game to beat procrastination

## How we built it
Built the user interface with CSS and React. Stored user data using Firebase.

## Challenges we ran into
We used figma to draft our application design, but ended up changing the format a lot due to difficulties with mobile app screen ratios.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to design and build a fully functional game out of React to help other students fight procrastination.

## What we learned
We learned how to implement a full web app using React, manage/store user data using Firebase, and effectively communicate with our teammates to efficiently complete our project.

## What's next for Castle
We hope to implement a community leader board to enable more engagement between users and add more customization features to the shop for the user’s personal castle.
